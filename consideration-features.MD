# Features in Consideration

List of things in consideration to be added in the future. Might be implemented when I have some motivations and free time.
- Arbitrary 2 columns for scatter plot (e.g. X-axis for xG, Y-axis for xA)
- Customizable plots (e.g. background color, plot type, colors for each player)
- Radar plot of given category
- Radar plot of given choices of metrics
- 3 players choice
- Implement Nginx because why not
- Implement limit of automatic plots based on cookies just to know how to do it
- Deploy in AWS or Google Cloud
